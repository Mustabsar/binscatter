binscatter: Binned Scatterplots
--------------------------------

binscatter is a Stata program which generates binned scatterplots.  These are a convenient way of observing the relationship between two variables, or visualizing OLS regressions.  They are especially useful when working with large datasets.

### Project Status ###

binscatter updates are coming.  I've received some excellent pull requests, and have a couple new features of my own in the works. Expect a new version in summer 2015.
